‚úç Handwritten Digit Recognition using CNN

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify images of digits (0‚Äì9) with high accuracy.

üîπ Key Features

Preprocessing of MNIST handwritten digit images.

CNN model built using TensorFlow/Keras (Convolution, Pooling, Fully Connected layers).

Model training and validation.

Accuracy evaluation and prediction visualization.

üìÇ Tech Stack

Python

TensorFlow / Keras for deep learnig and data handling and visualization
